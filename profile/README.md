## About UNDP

UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet.

## About UNDP Data

The UNDP Data organisation on GitHub hosts repositories dedicated to **advancing data-driven policy-making**. These projects - developed by teams across UNDP - align with the [UNDP Data Principles](https://data.undp.org/about#data-principles), emphasising reusability, interoperability and openness.
